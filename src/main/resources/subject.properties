subject.definition.expressions=Expressions are essential building blocks of any Java program, usually created to produce a new value,\
although sometimes an expression assigns a value to a variable. Expressions are built using values,\
variables, operators and method calls.
subject.information.expressions=Types of Expressions: While an expression frequently produces a result, it doesn't always. There are\
three types of expressions in Java:\
<br>1.	Those that produce a value, i.e., the result of\
<br>(1	+ 1)\
<br>2.	Those that assign a variable, for example\
<br>(v = 10)\
<br>3.	Those that have no result but might have a "side effect" because an expression can include a wide\
range of elements such as method invocations or increment operators that modify the state (i.e., memory)\
of a program.
subject.example.expressions=To see a few more expression examples take a look at the code below. The\
the text that is highlighted in bold are the expressions:<br>\
<br>int <b>cadence = 0;</b>\
<br><b>anArray[0] = 100;</b>\
<br>System.out.println(<b>"Element 1 at index 0: " + anArray[0]</b>);\
<br><br>\
<br>int <b>result = 1 + 2;</b> // result is now 3\
<br>if (<b>value1 == value2</b>) \
<br>System.out.println(<b>"value1 == value2"</b>);

subject.definition.variables=Variable is name of reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of memory location.\
It is a combination of "vary + able" that means its value can be changed.\
<br>-The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.\
<br>-A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.\
<br>-In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.

subject.information.variables=There are three types of variables in Java: local variable, instance variable, static variable.\
<br><b>Local Variable</b> - A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use\
this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the\
variable exists. A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.\
<br><b>Instance Variable</b> - A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called\
instance variable. It is not declared as static. It is called instance variable because its value is\
instance specific and is not shared among instances.\
<br><b>Static variable</b> - A variable which is declared as static is called static variable. It cannot be local.\
You can create a single copy of static variable and share among all the instances of the class. Memory\
allocation for static variable happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.

subject.example.variables=To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:\
 <br><br><b style = "color:indianred"> type variable = value;</b>\
<br><br>Where <b>type</b> is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and <b>variable</b> is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.\
  <br><br>Here's a demonstration of how to declare variables of different types:\
<br><br><b style = "color:indianred">int myNum = 5;\
<br>float myFloatNum = 5.99f;\
<br>char myLetter = 'D';\
<br>boolean myBool = true;\
<br>String myText = "Hello";</b>

subject.definition.primitives=The Java programming language is statically-typed, which means that all variables must first be declared before they can be used.\
This involves stating the variable's type and name, as you've already seen:\
<br><b>int gear = 1;</b>\
<br>Doing so tells your program that a field named "gear" exists, holds numerical data, and has an initial value of "1".\
A variable's data type determines the values it may contain, plus the operations that may be performed on it. In addition to int, the Java programming language supports seven other primitive data types. \
A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword.

subject.information.primitives=There are 8 types of primitive data types: boolean data type, byte data type, char data typeshort data\
type, int data type, long data type, float data type, double data type.\
<br><br><b style = "color:orange">Boolean</b> - The Boolean data type is used to store only two possible values: true and false. This data type\
is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions. The Boolean data type specifies one bit of\
information, but its "size" can't be defined precisely.\
<br>Example: Boolean one = false\
<br><br><b style = "color:orange">Byte</b> - The byte data type is an example of primitive data type. It isan 8-bit signed two's complement integer.\
   Its value-range lies between -128 to 127 (inclusive). Its minimum value is -128 and maximum value is 127. \
  Its default value is 0.\
The byte data type is used to save memory in large arrays where the memory savings is most required. \
  It saves space because a byte is 4 times smaller than an integer. It can also be used in place of "int" data type.\
<br>Example: byte a = 10, byte b = -20\
<br><br><b style = "color:orange">Short</b> - The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between -32,768 to \
  32,767 (inclusive). Its minimum value is -32,768 and maximum value is 32,767. Its default value is 0.The short data \
  type can also be used to save memory just like byte data type. A short data type is 2 times smaller than an integer.\
<br>Example: short s = 10000, short r = -5000\
<br><br><b style = "color:orange">Int</b> - The int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between \
  - 2,147,483,648 (-2^31) to 2,147,483,647 (2^31 -1) (inclusive). Its minimum value is - 2,147,483,648 and maximum \
  value is 2,147,483,647. Its default value is 0. The int data type is generally used as a default data type for \
  integral values unless if there is no problem about memory.\
<br>Example: int a = 100000, int b = -200000\
<br><br><b style = "color:orange">Long</b> - The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between\
   -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63) to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807(2^63 -1)(inclusive). Its minimum value is \
  - 9,223,372,036,854,775,808and maximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Its default value is 0. The long data \
  type is used when you need a range of values more than those provided by int.\
<br>Example: long a = 100000L, long b = -200000L\
<br><br><b style = "color:orange">Float</b> - The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.Its value range is unlimited. \
  It is recommended to use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point \
  numbers. The float data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency. Its default value is 0.0F.\
<br>Example: float f1 = 234.5f\
<br><br><b style = "color:orange">Double</b> - The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its value range is unlimited. \
  The double data type is generally used for decimal values just like float. The double data type also should never \
  be used for precise values, such as currency. Its default value is 0.0d.\
<br>Example: double d1 = 12.3\
<br><br><b style = "color:orange">Char</b> - The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. Its value-range lies between \
  '\u0000' (or 0) to '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).The char data type is used to store characters.\
<br>Example: char letterA = 'A'.

subject.definition.logical.operators=<b>Logical operator</b> is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions\
such that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions\
and on the meaning of the operator.\
Logical operators are mainly used to control program flow. Usually, you will find them as\
part of an if, a while, or some other control statement.

subject.information.logical.operators=The Logical operators are:\
<br>op1 <b>&&</b> op2\
<br>-- Performs a logical <b>AND</b> of the two operands.\
<br>op1 <b>||</b> op2\
<br>-- Performs a logical <b>OR</b> of the two operands.\
<br><b>!</b>op1\
<br>-- Performs a logical <b>NOT</b> of the operand.\
<br>The concept of logical operators is simple. They allow a program to make a decision based on multiple conditions.\
   Each operand is considered a condition that can be evaluated to a true or false value. Then the value of the\
   conditions is used to determine the overall value of the op1 operator op2 or !op1 grouping. The following examples\
   demonstrate different ways that logical conditions can be used.\
The && operator is used to determine whether both operands or conditions are true and.pl.

subject.example.logical.operators=For example:\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;<b style = "color:indianred; background:6EB9D1; border-radius: 15px;">if ($firstVar == 10 && $secondVar == 9) {\
\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("Error!");\
\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;};</b>\
<br>If either of the two conditions is false or incorrect, then the print command is bypassed.\
<br>The || operator is used to determine whether either of the conditions is true.\
<br>For example:\
<br><b style = "color:indianred;">&emsp;&emsp;if ($firstVar == 9 || $firstVar == 10) {\
\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("Error!");</b>\
<br>If either of the two conditions is true, then the print command is run.\
<br>Caution If the first operand of the || operator evaluates to true, the second operand will not be evaluated. \
  This could be a source of bugs if you are not careful.\
<br>For instance, in the following code fragment:\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;<b style = "color:indianred;">if ($firstVar++ || $secondVar++) {<br>&emsp;&emsp; print("\n"); <br>&emsp;&emsp;}</b>\
<br>variable $secondVar will not be incremented if $firstVar++ evaluates to true.\
<br>The ! operator is used to convert true values to false and false values to true. In other words, \
  it inverts a value. Perl considers any non-zero value to be true-even string values. For example:\
\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;<b style = "color:indianred;">$firstVar = 10;\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;$secondVar = !$firstVar;\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;if ($secondVar == 0) {\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print("zero\n");\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;}</b>\
<br>is equal to 0- and the program produces the following output:\
<br>zero\
<br>You could replace the 10 in the first line with "ten," 'ten,' or any non-zero, non-null value.\

subject.definition.casting=Casting is the action of converting between two different data types such as converting an \
  int to a double and vice versa. Examine the code below for examples of casting.

subject.information.casting=

subject.example.casting= **CastingExample.java\
package exlcode;\
public class CastingExample { \
// this converts 15.23 into an integer\
public static int exampleVariableOne = (int) 15.23;\
public static double exampleVariableTwo = exampleVariableOne;\
public static void main(String[] args) {\
System.out.println(exampleVariableOne);\
System.out.println(exampleVariableTwo);\
}\
}\
We just converted the double value 15.23 into an integer, which left only the whole number and the decimal places\
   to be cut off. There is no rounding, it just ignores the numbers after the decimal point during casting. When you \
  convert an int to a double, a decimal point will be added to match with the structure of a double. \
  For example, double varOne = (double) 15; assigns 15.0 to varOne.\
Even though it is possible to convert an int to a double without casting, it is best practice to always use casting for\
   precision and thorough logic. Also, be careful with the loss of precision when converting data types.\
   i.e. losing decimal points is losing precision.\


subject.definition.ternary.operator= Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)\
There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands.
   

subject.information.ternary.operator= It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. \
  It is often used to replace simple if else statements, see  the example and explanation below.

subject.example.ternary.operator=  Syntax \
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;\
Instead of writing:\
Example:\
int time = 20;\
if (time < 18) {\
System.out.println("Good day.");\
} else {\
System.out.println("Good evening.");}\
Using the Ternary operator you can simply write:\
Example\
int=time = 20;\
String result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";\
System.out.println(result);

subject.definition.keywords=Java keywords are also known as reserved words. Keywords are particular\

subject.example.keywords=

subject.definition.statements,.whitespace.&.indentation=      Java statements \
-	are instructions that tell the programming language what to do. A basic statement, like an assignment statement,\
  assigns a value to a variable, as shown in the first example.\
  White space consists mostly of the space character that you produce by hitting the space bar on your keyboard\
   and that is commonly used to separate words in sentences. \
  Indentation is used to make our code readable to other users, easier to edit, display how the braces match up and show \
  the logic of the program in an organized fashion. Please look at example two below to see how indentation of the if-else \
  statement makes it easy to see what is happening.

subject.information.statements,.whitespace.&.indentation= All Java statements must end in a semicolon (;).\
  This tells Java that it should attempt to process all information up to that semicolon.\
  There are four other white space characters in Java, the horizontal tab, the form feed, the carriage return, \
  and the linefeed. Depending on your platform, when you hit the return or enter key, you get either a carriage return\
 (the Mac), a linefeed (Unix) or both (DOS, Windows, VMS). This produces a hard line break in the source code text.\
Outside of String literals Java treats all white space and runs of white space (more than one white space character in\
 immediate succession) the same. It's used to separate tokens, and one space is as good as seven spaces, a tab and two /\
 carriage returns. Exactly which white space characters you use is primarily a result of what's convenient for human beings \
  reading the code. The compiler doesn't care.\
The goal of indentation is to show the logic of our program. Keeping indentation consistent throughout a program is essential.\
 For statements inside a left and right brace, increase the indenting by two spaces. When another pair of braces is nested \
  inside those braces, increase the indentation by another two spaces. It is a good idea to line up the braces vertically. \
  Keep in mind that the function of indentation is to make the program more readable and understandable, which saves an\
   immense amount of time when editing or refining your code.

subject.example.statements,.whitespace.&.indentation= Example 1\
double entryFee = 15.75;\
IndentationExample.java\
package exlcode;\
  Example 2 \
public class IndentationExample {\
// standard indenting increases by 2 spaces as shown below\
// braces are used even when optional\
public static void main(String[] args) {\
// neat indenting:\
// if-else will be explained in Unit 5\
if (true) {\
System.out.println("True");\
} else {\
System.out.println("False");\
}\
// no indenting:\
if(true)          System.out.println("True");\
else    System.out.println("False");\
}\
}

subject.definition.code.blocks=A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single\
statement is allowed. Java likes to keep things between the lines, no make that curly braces({}).

subject.information.code.blocks=
subject.example.code.blocks=This how we can start and stop a code block in Java. Braces gives the compiler a heads up of where we want to start({) and end(}).\
\
<br>package com.javablocks;\
 \
<br>public class JavaCodeBlocks {\
<br>public static void main (String arg[]) {\
<br>System.out.println(“Inside the Java code block”);\
<br>}\
<br>}\
<br><br>\
In our first example we have not one but two code blocks. First, for the JavaCodeBlock class with the open brace on line 3. Next on line 4 we open the main method with another open brace. Then we close it up on line 6 for the main method and line 7 for the class. A pro tip, most IDEs will highlight the closing brace when you put your cursor by the open brace and vice versa too.\
<br><br><div style = "background:#daedf0; font-style:italic; border:1px solid grey; border-radius: 10px;">\
&emsp;package com.javablocks;\
<br>&emsp;public class void main(String arg[]) {\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Boolean check = true;\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;If(check) {\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;System.out.println(“Check is true”);\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;}else {\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;System.out.println(“Check is false”);\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;{\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;System.out.println(“Just a random code block”);\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}\
<br>&emsp;&emsp;}\
<br>&emsp;}</div>\
<br><br>\
In this example we have an if else with each having their own code block. We don’t have to but helps with readability. Later on we have a random code block too. It looks like it should be wrong if you are new to development but it is perfectly legitimate.\
Java has a few types of code blocks :\
anonymous - Anonymous code blocks really stand out. They are also called instance initialization blocks. They are run before the constructor is called.\
named - We can also create blocks of code and give them a name.\
static - Java has another code block called static code block as we use the static keyword for them.

subject.definition.methods= Java methods are blocks of code that perform a task, and can be used by other parts of a \
  computer program, such as a declaration statement.
subject.information.methods=
subject.example.methods= For example, one basic function of a computer is display information to the screen. Why should \
 we have to re-write that logic over and over? Instead, this Java declaration statement uses a delivered function to \
 display information on multiple lines.\
System.out.println("Line 1");\
System.out.println("Line 2");\
And the output of the previous code.\
Remember, each Java statement ends with a semicolon.\
We've just seen the basic variable declaration statement in action. Now let's look at another example you'll see a lot: \
 a Java string statement, or a collection of characters or objects. For the purposes of this lesson, we won't be delving \
 into the nitty gritty of Java classes or blueprints and objects. We'll just focus on the statements themselves and how they're formulated.\
String entryCode = new String();


subject.definition.control.flow.statements=Generally the statements inside your java code are \
executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Control flow statements, change or break \
the flow of execution by implementing decision making, looping, and branching your program to \
execute particular blocks of code based on the conditions.

subject.information.control.flow.statements=There are 3 types of control flow statements supported by the Java programming language.\
<br>•	Decision-making statements : if-then, if-then-else, switch\
<br>•	Looping statements : for, while, do-while\
<br>•	Branching statements : break, continue, return.

subject.example.control.flow.statements=If_then - The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It enables your program to execute a certain section of code depending on the state of variables, or values returned from methods.\
<br>If(iscar)\
<br>{\
<br>System.out.println(“I am a car”);\
<br>}\
<br>If isCar test evaluates to false, control jumps to the end of the if-then statement. In Java, the opening and closing braces are optional.But this is applicable only if the block of code to be executed is just a single statement. But as a good practice, it is advisable to put the brackets around the statements, even if there is only one statement to execute.This is because, in the begining you may start with one statement and later during the development phase you may add more statements. During this a common mistake would be forgetting to add the newly required braces which compiler cannot catch.\
\
<br>The if-then-else statement provides a alternate path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to false. You can chain if-else statements, and create a decision tree sort of thing.\
\
<br>Switch statement - Another way to control the flow of your programs with decision-making statements is by a switch statement. A switch statement gives you the option to test for a range of values for your variables. If you think your if-else-if statements is long and complex, you can use switch statement instead.The body of a switch statement is known as a switch block. The switch statement evaluates its expression within the brackets, then executes all statements that follow the matching case label. Again there might be more than one cases being matched but switch will choose the first immidiate matching case ignoring the others.break statement is necessary.Because without it, statements in switch blocks fall through.\
\
<br>While statement - The while loop executes a set of statements while a certain conditions is true. In Java there are 2 variations of while loop: while and do-while loop. Here is a simple while loop example:\
\
<br>int counter = 0;\
<br>while(counter < 5) {\
<br>System.out.println(“Inside the while loop, counting: ” + counter);\
<br>counter ++;\
<br>}\
\
<br>This above while loop checks whether counter value is less than 5 to check if the statements inside while loop should be executed or not. If the counter value is less than 5, the while loop body is executed one more time else execution continues at the next statement after the while loop.\
\
<br>The other type of while loop is the do while loop:\
\
<br><br>int counter = 0;\
<br>do {\
<br>System.out.println(“Inside the while loop, counting: ” + counter);\
<br>counter ++;\
<br>\
<br>}while (counter < 5);\
<br><br>Notice the condition check is moved to end of while body in do-while construct. Which means statements inside the do while loop body is always executed at least once, and is then executed repeatedly while the while loop condition is true.\
This is the main difference between java while and do while loop, that the statements inside the do while loop is always executed at least once before the while loop condition is tested.\
For statement - The Java for loop repeats the execution of a set of Java statements. A for loop executes a block of code as long as some condition is true.\
for (initialization; termination condition; increment/decrement) {\

<br>The initialization expression initializes the loop and is executed only once at the begining when the loop begins. The termination condition is evaluated every loop and if it evaluates to false, the loop is terminated. And lastly increment/decrement expression is executed after each iteration through the loop.\
There are also branching statements: the break statement, the continue statement and the return statement.

subject.definition.classes= At its core, Java is an object-oriented language. It consists of objects, which are modules\
   that can have data and some instructions. An object should be able to sustain itself. An Employee object, for example,\
   contains some information about an employee. You can send salary, wage, benefit balances, etc. to the Employee object\
   and it can do something with that info.\
 A class, on the other hand, is used to create objects. Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects. In the following \
  example, the object is really an Employee. However, we've created a class so that we can structure the object to our needs. \
  Check out our example below. You'll notice the different portions of the Java code underneath the Employee object.

subject.information.classes=
subject.example.classes= public class Employee {\
public String empName; //Employee name\
public double hourly_rate, hours_worked;\
public double getWeeklyHours() {\
return (hourly_rate * hours_worked);\
}\
} //end of class

subject.definition.method.overloading= With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters(see example below).
subject.information.method.overloading= !! Note: Multiple methods can have the same name as long as the number and/or type of parameters are different.
subject.example.method.overloading= Example\
int myMethod(int x)\
float myMethod(float x)\
double myMethod(double x, double y)\
Consider the following example, which have two methods that add numbers of different type:\
Example\
static int plusMethodInt(int x, int y) {\
return x + y;\
}\
static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y) {\
return x + y;\
}\
public static void main(String[] args) {\
int myNum1 = plusMethodInt(8, 5);\
double myNum2 = plusMethodDouble(4.3, 6.26);\
System.out.println("int: " + myNum1);\
System.out.println("double: " + myNum2);\
}\
Instead of defining two methods that should do the same thing, it is better to overload one.\
In the example below, we overload the plusMethod method to work for both int and double:\
Example\
static int plusMethod(int x, int y) {\
return x + y;\
}\
static double plusMethod(double x, double y) {\
return x + y;\
}\
public static void main(String[] args) {\
int myNum1 = plusMethod(8, 5);\
double myNum2 = plusMethod(4.3, 6.26);\
System.out.println("int: " + myNum1);\
System.out.println("double: " + myNum2);\
}

subject.definition.static.vs.instance.variables.and.methods= Instance Method are methods which require an object of its class to be created before \
  it can be called. To invoke an instance method, we have to create an Object of the class in within which it defined.\
  Static methods are the methods in Java that can be called without creating an object of class. They are referenced by\
  the class name itself or reference to the Object of that class.\
  Static Variables: When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of the variable is created and shared among \
  all objects at a class level. Static variables are, essentially, global variables. All instances of the class share the same static variable.\
  Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block.

subject.information.static.vs.instance.variables.and.methods=   Important Points for the Instance Method:\
•	Instance method(s) belong to the Object of the class not to the class i.e. they can be called after creating the Object of the class.\
•	Every individual Object created from the class has its own copy of the instance method(s) of that class.\
•	Instance methods are not stored on a per-instance basis, even with virtual methods. They’re stored in a single memory \
  location, and they only “know” which object they belong to because the this pointer is passed when you call them.\
•	They can be overridden since they are resolved using dynamic binding at run time.\
Important Points for the Static methods:\
•	Static method(s) are associated to the class in which they reside i.e. they can be called even without creating an \
  instance of the class i.e ClassName.methodName(args).\
•	They are designed with aim to be shared among all Objects created from the same class.\
•	Static methods can not be overridden. But can be overloaded since they are resolved using static binding by compiler at compile time.\
Instance method vs Static method\
•	Instance method can access the instance methods and instance variables directly.\
•	Instance method can access static variables and static methods directly.\
•	Static methods can access the static variables and static methods directly.\
•	Static methods can’t access instance methods and instance variables directly. They must use reference to object.\
   And static method can’t use this keyword as there is no instance for ‘this’ to refer to.\
  Important points for Static  Variables:\
•	We can create static variables at class-level only. \
•	static block and static variables are executed in order they are present in a program.\
Important points for Instance Variables:\
•	As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.\
•	Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier then the default access specifier will be used.\
•	Initialization of Instance Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0\
•	Instance Variable can be accessed only by creating objects.

subject.definition.encapsulation= The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:\
- declare class variables/attributes as private\
- provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable.

subject.information.encapsulation= Get and Set\
You learned from the previous chapter that private variables can only be accessed within the same class (an outside class has\
   no access to it). However, it is possible to access them if we provide public get and set methods.\
The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.\
Syntax for both is that they start with either get or set, followed by the name of the variable, with the first letter in upper case (see example below).

subject.example.encapsulation= Example\
public class Person {\
private String name; // private = restricted access\
// Getter\
public String getName() {\
return name;\
}\
// Setter\
public void setName(String newName) {\
this.name = newName;\
}\
}\
!! Example explained\
The get method returns the value of the variable name.\
The set method takes a parameter (newName) and assigns it to the name variable. The this keyword is used to refer to the current object.\
However, as the name variable is declared as private, we cannot access it from outside this class:\
Example\
public class MyClass {\
public static void main(String[] args) {\
Person myObj = new Person();\
myObj.name = "John";  // error\
System.out.println(myObj.name); // error \
}\
}\
If the variable was declared as public, we would expect the following output: John.\
However, as we try to access a private variable, we get an error:\
MyClass.java:4: error: name has private access in Person\
myObj.name = "John";\
^\
MyClass.java:5: error: name has private access in Person\
System.out.println(myObj.name);\
^\
2 errors\
Instead, we use the getName() and setName() methods to acccess and update the variable:\
Example\
public class MyClass {\
public static void main(String[] args) {\
Person myObj = new Person();\
myObj.setName("John"); // Set the value of the name variable to "John"\
System.out.println(myObj.getName());\
}\
}\
// Outputs "John"


subject.definition.polymorphism= Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
subject.information.polymorphism= Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. \
 Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
subject.example.polymorphism= For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). \
  Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):\
Example\
class Animal {\
public void animalSound() {\
System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");\
}\
}\
class Pig extends Animal {\
public void animalSound() {\
System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");\
}\
}\
class Dog extends Animal {\
public void animalSound() {\
System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");\
}\
}\
Remember from the Inheritance chapter that we use the extends keyword to inherit from a class.\
Now we can create Pig and Dog objects and call the animalSound() method on both of them:\
Example\
class Animal {\
public void animalSound() {\
System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");\
}\
}\
class Pig extends Animal {\
public void animalSound() {\
System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");\
}\
}\
class Dog extends Animal {\
public void animalSound() {\
System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");\
}\
}\
class MyMainClass {\
public static void main(String[] args) {\
Animal myAnimal = new Animal();  // Create a Animal object\
Animal myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object\
Animal myDog = new Dog();  // Create a Dog object\
myAnimal.animalSound();\
myPig.animalSound();\
myDog.animalSound();\
}\
}

subject.definition.autoboxing.and.unboxing= Autoboxing is converting a primitive value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class is called autoboxing. \
 Unboxing is converting an object of a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive value is called unboxing.

subject.information.autoboxing.and.unboxing=
subject.example.autoboxing.and.unboxing=  For example, converting int to Integer class. The Java compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is:\
• Passed as a parameter to a method that expects an object of the corresponding wrapper class.\
• Assigned to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class.\
For example conversion of Integer to int. The Java compiler applies unboxing when an object of a wrapper class is:\
• Passed as a parameter to a method that expects a value of the corresponding primitive type.\
• Assigned to a variable of the corresponding primitive type.
